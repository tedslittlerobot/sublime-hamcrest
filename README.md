Sublime Text 2/3 Snippets for the Hamcrest PHP library

(hamcrest in general, really, but i've made these specifically for php. eventually, i'll check these against others and use ST's scope availability to limit them to languages)

## Installation

Clone the folder to Sublime Text's `packages` directory. I can't really put in on package manager until it's got more than a few snippets...!
